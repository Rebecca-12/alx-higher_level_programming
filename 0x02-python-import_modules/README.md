# Project: Python Import and Modules

## Overview

This project focuses on mastering Python's import and module system, covering fundamental concepts such as importing functions, command line arguments, and module creation. The tasks involve creating scripts, adhering to specific coding standards, and demonstrating a solid understanding of Python programming.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Import a simple function from a simple file
- Create a program that imports the `add` function from the file `add_0.py`.
- Print the result of adding 1 and 2.

### Task 1: My first toolbox!
- Import functions from `calculator_1.py` to perform basic mathematical operations.
- Print the results of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using predefined variables.

### Task 2: How to make a script dynamic!
- Write a program that prints the number and list of its arguments.
- Handle different cases, including no arguments, one argument, and multiple arguments.

### Task 3: Infinite addition
- Develop a program that prints the result of adding all arguments.
- Support casting arguments into integers and handle both small and large numbers.

### Task 4: Who are you?
- Write a program that prints names defined by the compiled module `hidden_4.pyc`.
- Print names in alphabetical order, excluding those starting with '__'.

### Task 5: Everything can be imported
- Create a program that imports the variable 'a' from the file `variable_load_5.py`.
- Print the value of the imported variable.

## Requirements and Guidelines

- Follow specific coding standards, including file structure and naming conventions.
- Use allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- Ensure code is executable and compatible with Python 3.8.5.
- Include a `README.md` file at the root of the project folder.
