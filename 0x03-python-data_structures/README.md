# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## Description

This project covers various tasks related to Python programming, focusing on data structures such as lists and tuples. Each task has specific requirements and objectives aimed at enhancing your understanding of Python's features.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into multiple tasks, each represented by a separate Python file. Here's an overview of the main files:

- `0-print_list_integer.py`: Print a list of integers.
- `1-element_at.py`: Secure access to an element in a list.
- `2-replace_in_list.py`: Replace an element in a list.
- `3-print_reversed_list_integer.py`: Print a list of integers in reverse.
- `4-new_in_list.py`: Replace an element in a list without modifying the original.
- `5-no_c.py`: Remove all occurrences of 'c' and 'C' from a string.
- `6-print_matrix_integer.py`: Print a matrix of integers.
- `7-add_tuple.py`: Add two tuples.
- `8-multiple_returns.py`: Return the length and first character of a string.
- `9-max_integer.py`: Find the biggest integer in a list.
- `10-divisible_by_2.py`: Identify multiples of 2 in a list.
- `11-delete_at.py`: Delete an item at a specific position in a list.
- `12-switch.py`: Switch the values of two variables.
- `13-is_palindrome.c`, `lists.h`: Check if a singly linked list is a palindrome (C implementation).
- `100-print_python_list_info.c`: C function to print information about Python lists.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8.5
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Editors: vi, vim, emacs

## Usage

Each Python script can be executed individually to test the functionality of the implemented tasks.

Example:
```bash
./0-main.py

For the C implementation (13-is_palindrome.c), compilation and execution details are provided in the corresponding task description.
